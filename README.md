# passdb-frontend

Connects with the [passdb-backend](https://github.com/audibleblink/passdb-backend) which serves an API for searching through a self-seeded password dump
database. Users of the app are able to search by `username`, `password`, `domain`, or `email`. From
the results page, users may pivot around on any clickble piece of information.

This is a fully decoupled frontend single-page app which creates API calls to `http://localhost:4567`

Searching for a specific email will show HIBP breach information.
